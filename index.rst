PeridexisErrant's DF Walkthrough
################################

The learning curve for Dwarf Fortress has been described as a spiked
overhang - but many of us have fought our way up, and have more fun
than any other game around.  This walkthrough, along with the
:forums:`DF Starter Pack <126076>`, are my attempts to dangle a rope
down, as the community first did for me years ago.


The Walkthrough
===============
Dwarf Fortress is a rare game:  every time you start a new game, an
entire world is created anew - everything from geology and weather,
to the patterns of trade in wheat and wars between jealous kings.
The fact that there is no script, no standard storyline that every
player goes through, makes a traditional game walkthrough impossible.

Instead this is more like a tutorial campaign in a strategy game -
right down to playing on the same map, if you download the suggested
package.  You're free to follow along exactly, but also encouraged to
experiment (and maybe back up your save occasionally).

Remember as you play that no matter how skilled you become, without a
winning condition your fortress will inevitably fail - then pick yourself
up,  reflect on what you learnt, and recite the motto:  **Losing is Fun!**

Tutorials
=========
The walkthrough covers the topics you'll need in every fortress, in just
enough detail to get you started.  After that, it's your decision what
to focus on - the options are endless, from beekeeping to soap-making to
digging too deep, or learning how to install or make mods for the game.

Each tutorial is a short, self-contained introduction to a topic which is
likely to be of interest to players who have just finished the walkthrough.
